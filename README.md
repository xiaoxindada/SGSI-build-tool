Patch1 Patch2 Needs to be packaged to vendor.img Put system vendor Package generation super.img Then swipe in then swipe in patch3 format data Can
This tool only makes system.img section Patch Some need to be manually  
This tool is a semi-automatic tool, because some processing automation is not ideal and changeable, so manual is better. If you donâ€™t know how to deal with these things, you can just not process them and make them directly.
